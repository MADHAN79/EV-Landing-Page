# EV-OLUTION

### Tech used:

1. React18
2. Created with Vite

### Project Brief:

It's a clean and professional landing page for an E.V vehicle company and an U.I based React project where I have tested my knowledge on React18 fundamentals and reinforcing the web development fundamentals like CSS & JAVASCRIPT for dynamic image & video rendering logic along with React18.

Hope you like my design language :)
